This is my "Hello Gitty" project.
========================================================================

I made this python script to get better overview about all the files 
inside some folders and to search, filter and open the files quickly 
without moving back and forward between folders. It can be also used to 
mesuring total size of of some types of files in folder. It also can 
take arguments from terminal to specify search_word and folder. 
Search_word filters out all files that have this text written inside 
them.
